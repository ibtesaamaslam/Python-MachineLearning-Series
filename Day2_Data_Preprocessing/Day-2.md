Day 2: Data Handling & One-Hot Encoding 🚀
This project focuses on essential data preprocessing techniques in Machine Learning. Before feeding data into a model, it’s crucial to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and standardize numerical features.

📌 Key Steps Covered in This Notebook
✅ Handling Missing Data – Using SimpleImputer to replace missing values with the mean.
✅ Encoding Categorical Data – Using One-Hot Encoding for independent variables & Label Encoding for dependent variables.
✅ Splitting Data – Dividing the dataset into Training & Testing sets using train_test_split().
✅ Feature Scaling – Standardizing numerical data using StandardScaler().

📊 Why Are These Steps Important?
🔹 Data Preprocessing is the foundation of any ML model – A well-prepared dataset leads to better predictions.
🔹 Missing Data Can Distort Results – Imputation techniques ensure models learn meaningful patterns.
🔹 Categorical Variables Need Encoding – ML models work with numerical inputs, so encoding is necessary.
🔹 Feature Scaling Improves Performance – Helps models converge faster and prevents dominance of large-scale values.
